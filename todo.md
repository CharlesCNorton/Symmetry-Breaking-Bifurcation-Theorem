### 1. Define $\Delta G$ via isotropy

Let

$$
\Delta G(t) = |G| - E\,|H(t)|,
$$

where $H(t) \subseteq G$ is the isotropy subgroup of the deformed state (or the minimizer of a $G$-invariant energy) under a specified ensemble of perturbations.
This formulation ties $\Delta G$ to the isotropy lattice of $G$ used in EBL.

### 2. Specify dynamics

Choose a class of $G$-equivariant flows

$$
u_t = F(u; \lambda)
$$

or energies

$$
E_{\lambda}(u)
$$

with a single control parameter $\lambda$ encoding deformation.
Assume a generic loss of normal hyperbolicity at $\lambda_c$ and apply center-manifold or normal-form reductions.

### 3. Assume channel independence or a mean-field limit

Model symmetry-failure events along cosets/irreducible representations as weakly coupled Poissonian channels.
Under standard scaling, the survival factor over channels multiplies, leading to the hazard law:

$$
1 - \exp(-\dots)
$$

### 4. Relate $\Lambda_d(n)$ and $\beta_d(n)$ to representation data

Replace $n$ with counts of relevant irreducible representations (or multiplicities in the critical eigenspace).
This approach ties “complexity damping” directly to actual mode counts rather than polygon faces—tightening the link to normal-form theory.
